/***
 * See https://www.FreeRTOS.org/coremqtt for configuration and usage instructions,
 * and https://www.freertos.org/mqtt/mqtt-agent-demo.html? for an alternative
 * usage model that runs MQTT in an autonomous background agent task.  See the
 * note below.
 *
 * Note: Single Threaded Vs Multi Threaded
 * There are two coreMQTT usage models, single threaded and multithreaded
 * (multitasking). Using the MQTT library solely from one thread within an
 * otherwise multi-threaded application, as the demos in these subdirectories do,
 * is equivalent to the single threaded use case. Single threaded use cases
 * require the application writer to make repeated explicit calls into the MQTT
 * library. Multithreaded use cases can instead execute the MQTT protocol in the
 * background within an agent (or daemon) task. Executing the MQTT protocol in
 * an agent task removes the need for the application writer to explicitly
 * manage any MQTT state or call the MQTT_ProcessLoop() API function. Using an
 * agent task also enables multiple application tasks to share a single MQTT
 * connection without the need for synchronization primitives such as mutexes.
